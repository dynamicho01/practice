  <h2>MD simulation</H2>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics" target="_blank" title="Molecular Dynamics">Molecular dynamics (MD)</a> is a computer simulation method for analyzing the physical movements of atoms and molecules. The atoms and molecules are allowed to interact for a fixed period of time, giving a view of the dynamic "evolution" of the system. In the most common version, the trajectories of atoms and molecules are determined by numerically solving Newton's equations of motion for a system of interacting particles, where forces between the particles and their potential energies are often calculated using interatomic potentials or molecular mechanics force fields. The method is applied mostly in chemical physics, materials science, and the biophysics.
